        Hi, I'm Christopher Tytone, a computer science major with a passion for all things computers and learning about new technology. I love using computers and working with them. My goal is to minor in Cyber Security and work in that field in the future. My plan is to stay on the Computer Science track and get a job with my cousin who can get me a Cyber Security job at a hospital in New York. I intend to work hard and passionately because this is what I know I truly want to do.

            <p>There currently is no central campus lost and found system, making it difficult for students 
                to report, track, and recover lost items.</p>

    Wireframe sketches are a great way to develop a prototypical view of an app that you are designing. My group and I decided to create three different scenarios for three different kind of users using our app. One scenario is a user who lost an item and is on the forum trying to recover it, the second scenario is a user who found a lost item and is wanting to report it on the forum, and the third scenario is a data scientist who wants to collect different metrics about the most common places items are lost, what kinds of items are lost the most, and how many items have been recovered, lost, or are in the process of recovery now. The data scientist can export all of this data into a usable format, e.g. a .csv file for data processing and metrics in case they would want to visualize this data for presentation.
